The public_figures.csv file contains information about 226 20th and 21st-century public figures. Please read the `public_figures_data_dictionary` file on on GitHub for a more complete description of the variables. The objective of this project is to build a model to predict the likability rating of a public figure, based primarily on their personality.

In this project, we did EDA, employed a principal component analysis (PCA) to identify perosnality types that explained the largest amount of variance, and built two prediction models: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Random Forests, in order to predict a subjects likability based on their personality.
